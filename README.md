COEN-233 - Computer Networks project

Assignment 1 needs port and hostname during execution, while assignment 2 assumes PORT number: 8081. If this port is occupied, you might need to change it to an open port and recompile both programs.


Each Assignment directories have their own readme.txt with instructions on how to execute along with a Screenshots directory.
